Improving the code generally involves making it more readable, maintainable, robust, efficient, and potentially extensible. Here are areas and techniques to consider:
1. Code Readability and Formatting:
Consistent Formatting: Use a tool like Prettier or ESLint with a standard configuration (like Airbnb, StandardJS, or Google) to automatically enforce consistent indentation, spacing, quotes, etc. This makes the code much easier to scan visually.
Meaningful Variable/Function Names: Use descriptive names (e.g., fetchGiveawayDetails instead of fgd, giveawayElement instead of g). Avoid single-letter variables except for simple loop counters (like i).
Comments: Add comments to explain why something is done, not just what it does, especially for complex logic, workarounds, or non-obvious choices. Explain the purpose of functions and key code blocks.
Constants: Use const for variables that won't be reassigned. Use let only when reassignment is necessary. Avoid var. Define constants for magic numbers or strings (e.g., const POINTS_THRESHOLD_KEY = 'sgajm_points_threshold';).
2. Code Structure and Modularity:
Break Down Large Functions: If you have monolithic functions doing many things (e.g., finding links, filtering, clicking, updating UI), break them into smaller, single-purpose functions (e.g., findGiveawayLinksOnPage, filterGiveaways, joinGiveaway, updateStatusDisplay). This improves testability and reusability.
Object-Oriented or Functional Approach: Consider organizing related functions and state into objects or classes (e.g., a GiveawayHandler class or a SettingsManager object). Alternatively, use a more functional approach with pure functions where possible.
Configuration Management: Separate configuration logic (loading/saving settings using GM_getValue/GM_setValue) from the core joining logic. Have a dedicated function or object to handle settings.
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression): Ensure the entire script is wrapped in an IIFE (function() { ... })(); or a similar pattern ((() => { ... })();) to avoid polluting the global scope of the webpage.
3. DOM Interaction:
Robust Selectors: Avoid overly fragile selectors. Instead of relying on complex paths or indices (div > div:nth-child(3) > a), use specific classes or IDs added by SteamGifts if they are stable. If not, use more resilient attribute selectors ([data-giveaway-id], if available) or combinations of classes.
Check for Element Existence: Before trying to interact with a DOM element (e.g., .click(), .textContent), always check if the element was actually found by your selector (if (element) { ... }). SteamGifts might change its layout, causing selectors to fail.
Efficient DOM Traversal: Minimize querying the entire document repeatedly. If you find a container element, query within that element for sub-elements (container.querySelector(...)).
Avoid innerHTML for Inserting Text: When inserting text content provided by the site (like game names), use .textContent instead of .innerHTML to prevent potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the text contains unexpected HTML. Use innerHTML only when you specifically need to inject HTML structure you control.
4. Asynchronous Operations (Joining, Fetching Data):
Use async/await: This makes asynchronous code (like using GM_xmlhttpRequest or fetch for joining or getting details) much easier to read and write compared to nested callbacks or .then() chains.
Proper Error Handling: Wrap await calls in try...catch blocks to handle network errors, timeouts, or non-OK HTTP responses (e.g., 404, 403, 500 errors from SteamGifts). Log errors clearly (console.error).
Rate Limiting/Throttling: Implement delays (await delay(ms);) between join attempts correctly. Ensure the delay respects user configuration and prevents hammering the server. Consider adaptive delays if you encounter rate-limiting errors.
Concurrency Management: If the script tries to join multiple giveaways "simultaneously", ensure you don't overwhelm the browser or the server. Maybe process giveaways sequentially or in small, controlled batches.
5. State Management:
Clear State Variables: Keep track of the script's state (e.g., isJoining, currentPoints, filteredGames) in well-named variables.
Reliable Settings Storage: Use GM_getValue and GM_setValue (or their asynchronous counterparts if available/needed) correctly. Provide default values when reading settings in case they haven't been saved yet. Handle potential data type issues (values from storage are often strings).
6. Robustness and Error Handling:
Defensive Programming: Assume things can go wrong. Check return values, validate data fetched from the site, handle unexpected page structures gracefully.
Clear Error Messages: Log informative error messages to the console (console.error) to help debug issues. Include context (e.g., which giveaway failed, what the error was).
Handling Site Updates: Acknowledge that SteamGifts updates will break the script. Structure the code (especially selectors and parsing logic) to be as easy to update as possible.
7. Performance:
Optimize Loops: Avoid doing heavy work (like complex DOM queries) inside loops if possible.
Event Listeners: If using event listeners, add them judiciously and remove them if the elements they are attached to are removed (memory leaks). Use event delegation if applicable.
Throttling/Debouncing: For UI interactions or frequent checks, consider throttling or debouncing functions to prevent them from running too often.
